This is extremely experimental, use at your own risk.

It seems to work in my Asus UL30VT and I see other DSDTs from
Asus systems that look similar, YMMV.

Build the asus-switcheroo.ko kernel modules:

# make

On a Fedora system, you can then install with:

# sudo make install

This will:

 - copy the kernel module in place
 - update modprobe.d to load asus-switcheroo before nouveau
 - update dracut to add asus-switcheroo
 - install the suspend/resume script
 - run depmod
 - build a new initramfs

For other distros, do something similar.

For simply disabling the discrete graphics, the only other thing
you need to do (aside from rebooting), is:

# echo OFF > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch

If this isn't automatically mounted for you, add this to your
/etc/fstab:

debugfs		/sys/kernel/debug	debugfs	defaults	0 0

See the suspend resume script for a description of an issue
and workaround for suspend resume and powering off the other
device.

If you want to run with nouveau graphics, echo DIS to the
above switch file.  The LVDS will go black, but if you start
X after the switch, it has been known to work.  Plugging in
an HDMI monitor also seems to kick the text mode into working
and will continue working when the monitor is unplugged.

When running with the discrete graphics, there seem to be
numerous issues with the Intel driver forgetting that it
turned off it's hardware.  For instance in VT mode, if
left idle, the Intel driver will try to attempt to turn
the LVDS off even though the hardware has been put to sleep,
resulting in an oops.  I've also seen an oops when opening
the lid when using discrete graphcis via nouveau where the
Intel driver gets the lid notification and tries to touch
the hardware.

Using the discrete graphics is generally not recommended
for an average user.  Patches welcome to make this better.

It is also possible, though very, very alpha and extremely
not recommended for average users to use the asus-switcheroo
module as a dummy switcheroo client that allows you to run
the proprietary nvidia module.  To do this, blacklist
nouveau and rebuild your initramfs to get nouveau out of it.
Use the dummy-client=1 option for asus-switcheroo, if loaded
from initramfs, use asus-switcher.dummy-client=1.  At boot,
switch to DIS, modprobe nvidia, then start X using the nvidia
proprietary driver.  Note that the screen LVDS will go black
as soon as you switch via DIS and will not come back until X
starts.  Unlike nouveau above, there is no framebuffer driver
with nvidia, so text mode access is gone.  All of the above
nouveau problems are also expected to happen with nvidia.
Also, when using the dummy-client, the switch to discrete
graphics is a one-way street.  Reboot to re-enable IGD.
